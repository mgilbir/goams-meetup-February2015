# Go at a startup: My experience after one year

This talk was delivered at the [Go Amsterdam meetup on February 5, 2015](http://www.meetup.com/golang-amsterdam/events/219745391/)

In this talk I describe how one year ago at the startup I'm currently working for we decided to move from python. Since then we use go intensively for our own apps and we've gradually seen how go developed applications are appearing all over our architecture. I'll be sharing our experience, some things that have tripped us a few times and show some examples of where go makes things much easier
